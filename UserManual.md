## <span style="color:#00853E;"> FAQ</span>

**Q: I forgot my password. Can I change it?**   
**A:** If you happen to forget your password, please reset your password through UNT's account management system. Once you reset your password, you can log back into the FRAS system using your new credentials.

**Q: My camera is not working when I try to record attendance. What should I do?**   
**A:** Please make sure that you have allowed your browser to access your camera. You can allow this permission in your browser's privacy settings. If that doesn't fix the issue, please try refreshing the page. If you are using an external webcam, please check that it is connected correctly. 

**Q: What happens if multiple students appear at once?**   
**A:** The system will reject the scan and the student will need to fill the camera.  

**Q: What do I do if FRAS doesn't recognize my face?**   
**A:** If your facial scan fails, please ensure that you are attempting your scan in a well-lit enviroment. Please avoid wearing hats in the process, or anything face coverings. If the issues continues, inform your instructor and they can manually mark your attendance as present. If the issue persist, please contact support at UNT.FRAS@gmail.com.

**Q: How is my data stored?**  
**A:** All attendance data is encrypted and securely stored in Firebase Firestore.

**Q: Is my camera feed stored?**   
**A:** No. FRAS handles facial data in real time, but does not store any video footage or camera images. Once a scan is processed, all data collected from that scan is deleted.

**Q: Who can I contact if I see an issue in my attendance records?**   
**A:** Please contact your instructor if you see an error in your attendance records. They can view your attendance records and correct any issues directly. If the issue is a system error, please contact support at UNT.FRAS@gmail.com.

**A:** You cannot upload an image yourself. If you like to upload a new image, please contact support at UNT.FRAS@gmail.com.

**Q: How do I report a bug or technical issue?**   
**A:** Please attempt to capture or screenshot the problem you are experiencing and email it to UNT.FRAS@gmail.com, along with a description of the problem. Also include any important information related to the problem such as your role, the browser you are using, and the hardware you are using.
